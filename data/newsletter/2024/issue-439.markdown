Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Developer Nation Survey](https://developereconomics.net/?member_id=haskell&utm_medium=nl_ad_1) (ad)
  > 🚀 Join thousands of devs worldwide in our 28th Developer Nation Survey! Share your experiences, shape future tech trends, and get a shot at winning prizes like a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7! Complete the survey & grab your exclusive Virtual Goody Bag!
  
- [Haskell.org and the Haskell Foundation Join Forces](https://blog.haskell.org/haskell-foundation-and-committee-merger/) by Hécate
  > The members of the Haskell.org Committee (the Committee) and the directors of the Haskell Foundation (the Foundation) are pleased to announce that we have joined forces, with the aim (subject to regulatory approval) of merging Haskell.org, Inc. and Haskell Foundation, Inc. into a single not-for-profit corporation. Together we continue our common mission to advance functional programming and to advocate for the Haskell language, its ecosystem, and its community.
  
- [Haskell For Dilettantes, Part 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyg7VU1NyvI) by Tea Leaves
  > We finish Homework 3, which gives us a completely playable Sokoban game including a start screen and win screen. I make many goofy mistakes along the way.
  
- [Math-Haskell Rosetta Stone - Part 1](https://www.danielbrice.net/blog/math-haskell-rosetta-stone/) by Daniel Brice
  > This post begins a short series meant to serve as an informal guide to reading Haskell code and translating back and forth with mathematics. It’s meant to help members of r/CategoryTheory understand posts that use Haskell code to convey ideas. My hope is that this series should also find use among Haskell programmers, as exposure to some of the basic methods and terminology used in modern math.
  
- [Playing With a Game](https://cdsmithus.medium.com/playing-with-a-game-0dd944082e2c) by Chris Smith
  > I thought I’d share this. It’s primarily about a game theory question, but ends up making some mildly interesting use of a probability library Shae Erisson and I wrote together when we used to get together to hack on random stuff on the weekends.
  
- [Scheduling threads like Thomas Jefferson](https://stevana.github.io/scheduling_threads_like_thomas_jefferson.html) by Stevan
  > This post is about how to schedule workers across a pipeline of queues in order to minimise total processing time, and an unexpected connection between this kind of scheduling and Thomas Jefferson.
  
- [Updated version of Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook free to read online](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1fmhbs9/updated_version_of_my_haskell_book_free_to_read/) by Mark Watson
  > I have released a new version of my Haskell book, new material on using OpenAI LLM APIs, using the Brave search APIs, lots of additional text explaining example code.

## In brief

- [An UI for draggable layers and groups using haskell-gi and GTK4](https://github.com/sheaf/gtk-layers) by sheaf

- [The mock library mockcat can now create partial mocks, and stubs for nonrecurring IO actions](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-the-mock-library-mockcat-can-now-create-partial-mocks-and-stubs-for-nonrecurring-io-actions/10411) by funnycat

## Show & tell

- [Applicative Logic](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/applicative-logic/10400) by Håkon Robbestad Gylterud
  > Just wanted to share my little applicative logic library. I wrote a blogpost a while ago which explains the ideas behind it using a few different examples. The introduction focuses on how this generalises the usual logical functions (and,or,all,any), but if it seems dry, just skip to the examples. I keep finding places in my Haskell code where these functions allow nice formulations of previously tedious parts. Especially the new function “convert” is way more useful than it has any right to be.

## Call for participation

- [Call for action: GHC on FreeBSD](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/call-for-action-ghc-on-freebsd/10385) by Bryan Richter
  > Today I took the initiative and created a FreeBSD CI runner on the gitlab.haskell.org platform. What this means is that there is now a path towards official testing and building of GHC on FreeBSD. With enough user contribution and enthusiasm, this could result in a revival of official FreeBSD support for future GHC releases.

- [cloudy: allow the user to set arbitrary names when creating instances](https://github.com/cdepillabout/cloudy/issues/4)
