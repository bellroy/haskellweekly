Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [8 months of OCaml after 8 years of Haskell in production](https://chshersh.com/blog/2023-12-16-8-months-of-ocaml-after-8-years-of-haskell.html) by Dmitrii Kovanikov
  > I’ve been using Haskell in production for 8 years. I’ve been using OCaml in production for 8 months. It’s time to compare those two languages.
  
- [Authentication and Standard Webhooks](https://hereabout.dev/posts/authentication-and-webhooks) by Phil Curzon
  > There are dozens of potential authentication service providers who you can go to to get something off the shelf: Auth0, Clerk, Cognito, Firebase Auth, SuperTokens, etc. Throughout my career, I've worked at many companies that integrated with many of these suppliers but they were always a well established fixture of the technology stack: something that required learning particular APIs or particular support contacts rather than an evaluation of their individual merits and their pricing structures.

- [GHC 9.8.4 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-8-4-is-now-available/10917) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.8.4.
  
- [GHC 9.12.1-rc1 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-12-1-rc1-is-now-available/10835) by Zubin Duggal
  > The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the release candidate for GHC 9.12.1.
  
- [GHC API: Call for requirements](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-api-call-for-requirements/10940) by Facundo Domínguez
  > I am pleased to announce that the Haskell Foundation and Tweag are resuming efforts to define a stable API for GHC, and that I will continue the work of Alexis King as coordinator of the initiative.
  
- [Haskell for Dilettantes 18: Monads!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouaR1A4ATdM) by Tea Leaves
  > You can never be too rich or, if talking about Haskell, spend too much time talking about Monads.
  
- [Myth and truth in Haskell asynchronous exceptions](https://kazu-yamamoto.hatenablog.jp/entry/2024/12/04/180338) by Kazu Yamamoto
  > This article explains my best current practices on asynchronous exceptions in Haskell using the standard library - `Control.Exception`. 
  
- [The Haskell Unfolder Episode 37: solving Advent of Code 2024 day 4](https://well-typed.com/blog/2024/12/haskell-unfolder-episode-37-solving-advent-of-code-2024-day-4/) by Andres Löh, Edsko de Vries
  > In this episode of the Haskell Unfolder, we are going to try solving the latest problem of this year’s Advent of Code live.

## Jobs

- [Senior Haskell developer position with CentralApp](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/senior-haskell-developer-position-with-centralapp/10836) by Ashesh Ambasta
  > CentralApp is looking to hire senior Haskell developers remote or on-site within the EU. Experience with Nix is a plus.

## In brief

- [ClickHaskell: ClickHouse DBMS driver](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/clickhaskell-clickhouse-dbms-driver/10871) by Dmitry Kovalev
  > My goal was to create a simple, efficient, maintainable, and easy-to-use client. I’ve put a lot of work into this project over the past year, and now I’m excited to share the results!
  
- [Servant and a weirdness in Keycloak](https://magnus.therning.org/2024-12-01-servant-and-a-weirdness-in-keycloak.html) by Magnus Therning
  > When writing a small tool to interface with Keycloak I found an endpoint that require the content type to be `application/json` while the body should be plain text. 

## Show & tell

- [My new book, Pragmatic Type-Level Design, is now completed and released!](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1h4r1ja/my_new_book_pragmatic_typelevel_design_is_now/) by Alexander Granin
  > As with my previous book, Functional Design and Architecture (Manning Publications, 2024), I aimed to provide a systematic guide on functional programming; this time it's type-level programming. Curry-Howard correspondence, System F, Propositional Logic, type-level isomorphisms, cumulative universes—nothing like that in my book. It is academism-free, avoids math completely, and is approachable to mere developers like me who just want to build real applications using ready type-level solutions and approaches.
