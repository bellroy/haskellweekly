Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Heftia: The Next Generation of Haskell Effects Management - Part 1.1](https://sayo-hs.github.io/blog/heftia/heftia-rev-part-1-1/) by Riyo
  > `heftia` is the first-ever effect system, not just among Haskell libraries but historically across all effect system implementations and languages, to completely implement both algebraic effects and higher-order effects.
  
- [Learning Physics with Functional Programming and Haskell](https://dev.to/estebanmarin/learning-physics-with-functional-programming-and-haskell-l1h) by EstebanMarin
  > Last year I learned that functional programming is a great tool to learn Physics, because it’s a great way to write math. You see, Physics is expressed in the language of Math. The relation of Math and code is now more present than ever. Therefore, applying my debugging skills as a software developer, I was able to get a deep understanding of physics whilst writing code, which was a lot of fun, and I want to share the experience with you.
  
- [Violating memory safety with Haskell's value restriction](https://welltypedwit.ch/posts/value-restriction) by welltypedwitch
  > A common issue in impure ML-style languages with polymorphism and mutable references is the possibility of _polymorphic references_.

## In brief

- [atomic-css (formerly web-view) - Type-safe, composable CSS utility functions](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-atomic-css-formerly-web-view-type-safe-composable-css-utility-functions/12144) by Sean Hess
  > The web-view library has been rewrtitten and refactored. The new library, `atomic-css` focuses on css utility functions which can be used with any html-combinator library. The `View` type with its built-in reader context has been moved to `Hyperbole`.
  
- [GHCup 0.1.50.2 release (LD breakage)](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-ghcup-0-1-50-2-release-ld-breakage/12114) by Julian Ospald
  > The main point of this release is the following ticket: [Disable GHCs aggressive selection of `ld.gold`](https://github.com/haskell/ghcup-hs/issues/1032).
  
- [Haskell bindings for llama.cpp — llama-cpp-hs](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-haskell-bindings-for-llama-cpp-llama-cpp-hs/12136) by tushar
  > I’m excited to share the initial release of llama-cpp-hs — low-level Haskell FFI bindings to llama.cpp, the blazing-fast inference library for running LLaMA and other local LLMs.

- [Servant v0.20.3.0 pre-release, try it out!](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/servant-v0-20-3-0-pre-release-try-it-out/12134) by Théophile Choutri de Tarlé
  > The Servant team is happy to announce the pre-release of Servant v0.20.3.0.

## Show & tell

- [Я ☞ ya-operators](https://muratkasimov.art/Ya/Packages/ya-operators) by Murat Kasimov
  > Here is the first real world use case of using Я - code generation.
  
- [Comparing Code: LeetCode Problems in Rust vs. Haskell](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2025/5/19/comparing-code-leetcode-problems-in-rust-vs-haskell) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today will be the first in a series where we’ll be exploring some LeetCode problems and comparing different solutions from Haskell and Rust. The main idea is to demonstrate how you might translate ideas between the recursive core of Haskell, and the loop-based framing of most other languages.
