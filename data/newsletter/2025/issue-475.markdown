Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Я ☞ Structural wrapper subtyping](https://muratkasimov.art/Ya/Articles/Structural-wrapper-subtyping) by Murat Kasimov
  > There are only 5 real types in Я: Void, Unit, Sum, Product and Arrow. That’s it! In this chapter I’m going to describe how to use them, how to wrap/unwrap them and why they are important.
  
- [Abstracting storage details with Effectful](https://fpringle.com/blog/abstracting-storage-details-with-effectful.html) by Frederick Pringle
  > How we can use algebraic effects to separate our storage definitions from their implementations.
  
- [Announcing Ecosystem Partnerships](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/announcing-ecosystem-partnerships/12230) by José Manuel Calderón Trilla
  > The Haskell Foundation is pleased to announce a new initiative: Ecosystem Partnerships. These are joint efforts between the Haskell Foundation and service providers with the aim of increasing investment into the wider Haskell ecosystem. These partners sell targeted work on open-source projects important to the Haskell ecosystem, with some of the funds being contributed to the Haskell Foundation for its continued community, infrastructure, and organizing work.
  
- [Episode 65 – Andy Gordon](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/65/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Andy Gordon from Cogna is interviewed by Sam and Matti. We learn about Andy’s influential work including the origins of the bind symbol in haskell, and the introduction of lambdas in Excel. We go onto discuss his current work at Cogna on using AI to allow non-programmers to write apps using natural language. We delve deeper into the ethics of AI and consider the most likely AI apocalypse.
  
- [HLS Render Plugin Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VHt0thoII) by Joseph Warren
  > This is a demo of a Haskell Language Server plugin, which adds customizable type driven actions, that can be run via code lenses.
  
- [Simple Hindley-Milner in Practice](https://www.andrevdm.com/posts/2025-05-29-simple-hm-in-practice.html) by Andre Van Der Merwe
  > In this post, you’ll learn how to build a lightweight Hindley–Milner type checker in Haskell. No advanced theory is required. We’ll apply it to a tiny, LISP-inspired language so you can focus on how inference works.
  
- [Starting from the End: Solving “Product Except Self”](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2025/6/2/starting-from-the-end-solving-product-except-self) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today we continue our series exploring LeetCode problems and comparing Haskell and Rust solutions. We’re staying in the realm of list/vector manipulation, but the problems are going to start getting more challenging!

- [The 'A' is for 'Accelerated': Checking ASCII with SWAR](https://www.mlabs.city/blog/checking-ascii-with-swar) by MLabs
  > In particular, we will focus on techniques around data parallelism working over packed data. Using ASCII verification as a test case, we will show not only how such techniques can be used, but how big of an improvement they present over 'regular' ways of solving the same problem in Haskell. As part of this, we will discuss various optimizations enabled by such an approach, as well as explain why they work. Lastly, we will see how this could be taken further, and what currently prevents us from doing this (easily) in GHC and Haskell today.

## Jobs

- [Haskell Software Developer at Heilmann Software](https://www.heilmannsoftware.com/de/job/haskell-softwareentwickler-m-w-d/)
  > We're looking for a Haskell developer with some previous experience, regardless of whether it was acquired in a traditional professional context. You're a team player who approaches complex challenges with creativity and pragmatism. It's important to us that you're able to think outside the box and understand complex problems holistically.

## In brief

- [MicroHs-0.13.0.0](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-microhs-0-13-0-0/12228) by Lennart Augustsson
  > I have just uploaded a new version, 0.13.0.0, of MicroHs to github (MicroHs). The main improvement in this version is that it supports Concurrent Haskell.
  
- [Servant v0.20.3.0 release](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/servant-v0-20-3-0-release/12240) by Théophile Choutri de Tarlé
  > The Servant team is happy to announce the final release of Servant v0.20.3.0.
  
- [Telescope - Work with scientific data files commonly used in astronomy](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-telescope-work-with-scientific-data-files-commonly-used-in-astronomy/12201) by Sean Hess
  > I’m pleased to annouce Telescope, a library to work with FITS and ASDF files, commonly used for astronomical observations such as Hubble, JWST, and DKIST.
  
- [Threadscope-0.2.15](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-threadscope-0-2-15/12197) by Teo Camarasu
  > I am happy to announce a new release of Threadscope, a graphical viewer for GHC’s eventlog files.
  
- [Funding the Haskell toolchain with Ecosystem Support Packages](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2025/06/haskell-ecosystem-support-packages/) by Adam Gundry 
  > Well-Typed are delighted to be working in partnership with the Haskell Foundation to offer Haskell Ecosystem Support Packages.
