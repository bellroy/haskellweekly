Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Я ☞ You don't really need monads](https://muratkasimov.art/Ya/Articles/You-don't-really-need-monads) by Murat Kasimov
  > It’s not a clickbait, there are no monads in Я. I still use monadic/comonadic adjectives just as a habit to describe stuff like binding and extension. However, monads are overwemingly overrated! Here is why.

- [A Bytecode VM for Arithmetic: The Parser](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/arithmetic-bytecode-vm-parser/) by Abhinav Sarkar
  > In this series of posts, we write a bytecode compiler and a virtual machine for arithmetic in Haskell.

- [Videos for the 2025 Haskell Ecosystem Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEWBHP0PvRw&list=PLQpeDZt0_xQe319u9EdkpxjibYFtGsugc) by The Haskell Foundation

## Jobs

- [Haskell Software Engineer for Remote Position](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-software-engineer-for-remote-position/12648) by Input Output Global
  > IOG is seeking a Prototype Engineer to support the development of prototypes, simulations, and models that connect research insights with engineering implementation. The ideal candidate will collaborate with experts such as cryptographers, system architects, and developers to work on forward-thinking blockchain initiatives. This role emphasizes independent work within Agile frameworks and includes designing algorithms, writing code, testing, and thorough documentation.

## In brief

- [GHC 9.10.3-rc2 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-10-3-rc2-is-now-available/12660) by Zubin
  > The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the second release candidate for GHC 9.10.3.
  
- [“Go To Underlying Type” HLS Plugin draft](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/go-to-underlying-type-hls-plugin-draft/12665) by Dobromir Nikolov
  > The PR has just been put up and it probably has a lot of quirks to iron out but it was very fun implementing it and I encourage everyone to go mess around with the HLS code base.

- [Weeder 2.10 released](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/weeder-2-10-released/12598) by Teo Camarasu
  > This release brings support for GHC-9.10 and GHC-9.12, and includes a significant performance improvement.

## Show & tell

- [Haskell RealWorld example with effectful](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1mh89i0/haskell_realworld_example_with_effectful/) by Eunmin Kim
  > Previously, I introduced [Arota](https://arota.ai), a schedule management service built with Haskell for people with ADHD. While we’re unable to share the actual source code of the service, we’re releasing the source code of an example application built with the same structure.

- [Heterogeneous-comparison - Comparison of distinctly typed values with evidence capture](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/heterogeneous-comparison-comparison-of-distinctly-typed-values-with-evidence-capture/12601) by L. S. Leary
  > There are times when values need to be tested for equality or compared for ordering, even if they aren’t statically known to be of equivalent types. Such a test, if successful, may allow that knowledge to be recovered.
  
- [I made my submission for the 2025 GMTK game jam in haskell!](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1mgpbo1/i_made_my_submission_for_the_2025_gmtk_game_jam/) by M1n3c4rt
  > XCUIT is a box-pushing puzzle game where the objective is to connect wires and form one continuous loop. Not only that, but the whole game resides on a looping motherboard grid (a torus), which gives room for creative puzzle solutions.
  
- [My Nix Setup for a Haskell + Lean Monorepo with Emacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1mhlzmz/my_nix_setup_for_a_haskell_lean_monorepo_with/) by Alexandra Aiello
  > Someone asked me to share my setup for Lean & Haskell with Nix and Emacs. I'm working on a project that uses a Lean and Haskell monorepo (Lean for formal stuff, Haskell for the actual implementation). 

- [Twentyseven 1.0.0](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2025-08-01-twentyseven.html) by Xia Li-yao
  > Twentyseven is a Rubik’s cube solver and one of my earliest projects in Haskell. The first commit dates from January 2014, and version 0.0.0 was uploaded on Hackage in March 2016.

## Call for participation

- [Call for contributors - Dataframe](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/call-for-contributors-dataframe/12594) by Michael Chavinda
  > I think things are fairly interesting now and the API is fast approaching stability. I think it’s a good time to on-board contributors.
  
- [Stack users: a short, or shorter, alternative to `–stack-yaml`?](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/stack-users-a-short-or-shorter-alternative-to-stack-yaml/12625) by Mike Pilgrem
  > Stack users, I am canvassing for views on introducing a short, or shorter, alternative to command line global flag `--stack-yaml`.
